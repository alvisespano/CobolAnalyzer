COBOL Analyzer is a prototype of a parsing and typing system for COBOL.
It is still under active development is currently in alpha stage.
We may target a few updates in the future, when we plan to fix some minor
bugs.
A prototype of a UI is also present in the repository but that project
is no longer maintained.


Currently supported features
	- island-parsing-like LALR parser
	- flow-type checking on variable reuse
	
Unsupported features or known bugs
	- abstract interpretation via polynomial domains
	- support of SQL constructs of COBOL85
